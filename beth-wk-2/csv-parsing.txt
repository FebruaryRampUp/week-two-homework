require 'csv'  #returns "true", so...it's true that there's a .csv file in the directory?

f = File.read('sample.csv')  #shows the contents of the file with newlines

parsed = CSV.parse(f)  #defines a variable consisting of an array of each line (row) in the .csv file, including the empty lines as empty arrays

parsed  #prints the above

parsed[0]  #prints the data in the 1st row in the .csv file, the first row being in the "0" position (?)

parsed[0][0]  #prints the data in the first column of the first row

parsed[1][0]  #returns nil, as there is no data in the first column of the second row
